Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently working full-time on Open Source software. Most of my
time is spent on [GoatCounter][gc], an open source web analytics platform
available as a hosted service (free for non-commercial use) or self-hosted app.
It aims to offer easy to use and meaningful privacy-friendly web analytics as an
alternative to Google Analytics or Matomo.

I've also written (and maintain) a whole bunch of other stuff over the years;
some of the more useful ones (for me, anyway ðŸ˜…) can be seen below. I also [have
a list on my website][code]

You can consider sponsoring me if you find any of this useful ðŸ˜… Since I'm
working on this full-time with little other source of income it goes directly
towards ensuring the long-term sustainability. I have a [one-time donation
form][c], if you prefer.

Feel free to just create a GitHub issue for questions, or just drop me an email
at martin@arp242.net
